We had a very busy week in the various cities throughout Utah County. Springville and Spanish Fork were working tirelessly to protect their communities as they saw some of the most severe conditions. Utah County Public Works was working through the night on several potential issues. We had a few minor issues, but overall, we weathered this last heat wave in good fashion. Utah County Emergency Management has prioritized flooding and has been actively monitoring the various waterways, debris basins, and rivers. debris basins continue to fill, and our crews are cleaning debris as fast as they can.

Update on weather for Utah County regarding flooding.

Utah County brought in a State Senior Hydrologist to give us a targeted look at the outlook for Utah County. They have provided a synopsis for the residents of Utah County. Outlook for Utah County as of 4/27/23: Increasingly high flows expected into, and through, next week. Flooding is not forecast at this time.... Streams, creeks, and rivers will experience significant rises moving forward into early next, especially low and mid elevation watersheds across the county. Waterways will be running high, fast, cold, and extremely dangerous increasing the risk of hypothermia and drowning with even brief periods of time in the water. Keep a safe distance from these waterways as banks may become unstable, and especially monitor children and pets closely as they quickly drown in these elevated flows. Some mid elevation waterways may approach bankfull conditions over the next several days, but flooding is not forecast. High pressure will bring a notable warming trend increasing temperatures to some 15-20 degrees above normal by early next week. Given record snowpack in our area mountains, these temperatures will lead to accelerated snowmelt of low and mid-elevation basins, leading to the high flows mentioned above.

Our Public Works crews are constantly monitoring and cleaning out the various debris basins throughout the county. We have been sending crews to areas of the rivers and canals to clear debris. These crews are working throughout the night.

Utah County is currently leasing extra heavy equipment in preparation for these kinds of surges in the water levels. Our people are doing amazing work.
