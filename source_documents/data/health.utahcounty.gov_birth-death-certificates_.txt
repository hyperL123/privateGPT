Filing a Death Certificate

Filing a Death Certificate: Utah law allows families to care for their dead without the services of a licensed funeral director. Families that do not retain a funeral director must file a death certificate and comply with state laws and rules regarding the disposition of human remains.To begin the death certificate, contact the Local Health Department in the county that the death occurred to assist you, or contact the State Office of Vital Records and Statistics for information on filing a death certificate. You may see https://vitalrecords.utah.gov/death/file-a-death-record  for more information on how to file a death certificate. If you need to contact the UCHD Office of Vital Records in this regard, please call 801-851-7526.
