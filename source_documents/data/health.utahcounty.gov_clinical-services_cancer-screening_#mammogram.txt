Skin Cancer Screening

Skin cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in the
United States, and Melanoma is the most serious form of this disease. The good
news is that it is highly treatable when detected early.

These ABCDEs of melanoma detection will help you to determine if you need to be screened or not:

Asymmetry – One half of the mole does not match the other half.

Border – The borders of the mole are irregular, ragged, blurred, or notched.

Color – The color of the mole is nor the same throughout. There may be different shades of tan, brown, black, red, blue, or white.

Diameter – The mole is larger than 6 millimeters (about ¼ inch, roughly the size of a pencil eraser).

Evolution – The mole has been growing or changed its shape or color.

Know that moles can look suspicious and turn out to be completely harmless, so finding one that has any of the characteristics mentioned above does not necessarily mean it is a type of cancer.

The Wellness Clinic offers FREE Skin Cancer Screenings once a month to the public.

Colorectal Cancer Screening

The Wellness Clinic offers the Fecal Immunochemical Test
(FIT) for anyone between the ages of 50-64 years who would like to be screened
for colorectal cancer.

The FIT test detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of colon cancer.   Click here for more information or call 801-851-7031.

Many people with colon cancer experience no symptoms in the
early stages of the disease.  Screening for colon cancer can detect signs
of cancer early, often before any symptoms develop.
