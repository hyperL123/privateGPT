About Us

The Utah County Bookmobile is open to anyone residing in Utah County, as well as Indianola (Sanpete County) and Vernon (Tooele County).

The Bookmobile provides on-site library service as well as mobile library service to outlying communities without immediate access to city libraries.

Our bookmobile makes 19 stops and serves 14 communities and three schools. There are over 5,000 items on the bookmobile. Â We offer access to interlibrary loans for those hard-to-find books. We're "Driven to Read"!

The Utah County Bookmobile is a joint effort of the Utah State Library, Utah County, Sanpete County (Indianola), and the Town of Vernon.
