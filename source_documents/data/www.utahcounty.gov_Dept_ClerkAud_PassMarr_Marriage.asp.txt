When To Apply

MARRIAGE LICENSES EXPIRE 32 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE! Licenses can be used immediately upon purchase, but must be used before/up to their expiration date. An expired license is no longer valid and a couple would need to get a new license to get married.
                                                
                                                IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that a couple wait until 10 to 14 days prior to their marriage date to apply for their license. If you apply for a license too early and your wedding has to be delayed, you will have to pay to get a new license if your current one expires before your new date. There are no extensions or refunds possible under Utah State law.

A license issued in Utah County may be used anywhere within the State of Utah.

A government issued picture ID that shows a date of birth is required for all applicants.

If a divorce has been granted within the last 60 days, you need to provide a certified copy of the divorce decree.

For information on a divorce filed in the State of Utah, contact the District Court that divorce was filed in. Directory of Utah District Courts

How Do I Change My Name?

We do not handle name changes through our office. We will send you a certified copy of your marriage license, which should be sufficient proof of your marriage to any government agency in the United States. International applicants may also need their certificate certified with an Apostille. See the Certified Copies page for ordering information. Name changes in the United States are typically handled by the Social Security Administration and the Driverâ€™s License Division.
For more information about Certified Copies, see the "Certified Copies" web page.
